This project is a full-stack Image Compressor web application built with a modern frontend and a robust Spring Boot backend. It enables users to upload multiple images, compress them efficiently, select output quality and format (JPG, PNG), and view detailed optimization reports showing before and after file sizes.

Key Features
Batch image upload and compression: Drag-and-drop interface supporting multiple images in one go.

Quality Selector: Adjust compression quality from 80% to lossless 100%.

Format Conversion: Convert images between JPG and PNG seamlessly.

Detailed Optimization Reports: View comprehensive stats including total size reduction, per-file savings, and processing time.

Instant ZIP downloads: Compress images are packaged into a downloadable ZIP archive.

Clean and responsive UI: Built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

Efficient backend: Developed in Spring Boot using Thumbnailator for high-quality image compression.

In-memory processing: No long-term file storage ensures privacy and fast response times.

Best practices: Well-structured backend including REST APIs, dependency injection, and modular services.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Axios

Backend: Spring Boot, Thumbnailator, Java

Others: H2 in-memory database (optional), TwelveMonkeys ImageIO (for format support)

Why This Project?
Built as a hands-on learning experience for Spring Boot, this app combines essential backend concepts like REST API design, dependency injection, and efficient file processing with frontend modern practices. It offers a practical, real-world use case for image optimization suited for developers, designers, and end-users alike.
