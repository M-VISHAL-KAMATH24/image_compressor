1. Quality Controller
Quality Selector Workflow:
User selects image files and picks quality (e.g. 80%, 90%, lossless) on frontend UI.
Frontend sends files plus quality parameter in request (e.g. /api/compress/batch?quality=0.8).
Spring Boot controller receives files and quality parameter.
Controller calls service layer, passing quality value to compression method.
Service compresses images using Thumbnailator with the specified output quality.
Compressed images (single or batch ZIP) are returned as response.
Frontend receives compressed images, displays previews or ZIP download option.
User downloads compressed images with chosen quality applied.
